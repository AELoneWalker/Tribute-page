        <p>Iron Man is one of my favourite superheroes in Marvel.
            His suit which is the most liked part of Iron Man is a very fascinating feature.
            In the endgame iron man was a superherowho sacrifices his life and saved the world.
            Everyone paid a tribute in the last after tony stark died.
            With only his inelligence and a million bucks, he became a self-made hero.</p>
